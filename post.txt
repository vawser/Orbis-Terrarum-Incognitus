My own personal take on Occultis Orbis Terrestere. Focuses on Atlantis, Lemuria and Mu.

During the 15th century the Europeans theorized there were many mystical lands just beyond the known horizon. In this world, their theories are true, with the mythical island of Atlantis and the lost continents of Lemuria and Mu now present in the world.

Atlantis, the ideal state mentioned in Plato's "The Republic", has fallen into decline and has splintered into multiple warring states. Only once Atlantis has re-united can it hope to utilize it's extensive technological potential and conquer to Europeans.

Lemuria, the bridge between Africa and India, is in many ways similar to the Indian subcontinent. A vast continent, there are many riches to be unearthed in Lemuria for those quick enough to secure them.

Mu, a progenitor civilization for the Egyptians and Mesoamericans, is home to the Mu people, who venerate the dragon gods, headed by the Dragon Emperor. The remaining Mu nations are beset by Polynesian tribes who have migrated from the Polynesian islands.
